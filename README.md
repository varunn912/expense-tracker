## Overview

This is a personal expense tracker web application built using Django. It allows users to log their expenses, categorize them, and provides automated expense categorization and future expense prediction features. This README.md file provides instructions for setting up and running the application on your local machine, as well as some additional information about its features and usage.

## Features

- **Expense Logging**: Easily log your daily expenses, including the date, description, amount, and category.

- **Automated Expense Categorization**: The application uses machine learning algorithms to automatically categorize expenses based on their descriptions. This makes it easier to track and manage your spending.

- **Future Expense Prediction**: The application provides predictions for future expenses based on your spending history. This can help you plan your budget more effectively.

- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts and log in to securely manage their expenses.
